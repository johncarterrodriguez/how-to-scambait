# How to Call Scammers
There are a number of ways to call scammers, here are some of the most popular ones.

## [BobRTC](https://bobrtc.tel)
BobRTC is a **fantastic** calling service that is specifically designed for scambaiting.  They have a curated phonebook with confirmed scammer numbers, and you can add a number to the phonebook at any time once you've earned enough XP!  They automatically use a random phone number and don't ask for any personal information.

## [TextNow](https://textnow.com)
TextNow is a popular option for testing numbers and for sending text messages to scammers.  Unfortunately, they often have issues with sign ins and registration, so you may want to use BobRTC if you have trouble getting an account. You may also use TextNow to call numbers that don't work (or have not yet been added to the phonebook) on BobRTC.
